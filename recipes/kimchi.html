    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kimchi, also spelled kimchee, is a beloved Korean dish made from fermented vegetables. I'm sharing our recipe for the most common variety of kimchi, which is made using napa cabbage (baechu). It is traditionally served as banchan (side dishes accompanying a meal).
    </p>
    <p>
        Kimchi is also used in kimchi fried rice, stews, dumplings, savory pancakes, and noodles. I also add it to sandwiches, wraps, and salad bowls.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Gochugaru</li>
        <li>Garlic and Ginger</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Rice Thickener</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the cabbage by cutting it in half lengthwise, removing the core, and slicing it into 1 Â½-inch pieces. Trim the root ends of the green onions, slice them in half lengthwise, and cut them into 2-inch pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the cabbage and green onions in a large bowl (or two bowls if needed). Sprinkle with salt and toss well to combine. Cover with a clean dish towel and let sit at room temperature until the cabbage wilts noticeably, about 1 to 2 hours. After 30 minutes, toss the cabbage to redistribute the salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the cabbage wilts, make the rice thickener by combining 1 tablespoon of rice flour and 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it forms a thick paste. Remove from heat and let cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the chili paste by combining the gochugaru, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, sugar, and water. Add 2 tablespoons of the cooled rice thickener and stir until well blended. Store in the fridge until the cabbage is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the cabbage is wilted, rinse it well under cold water (2 to 3 times) and set it aside to drain for 20 to 30 minutes (or use a salad spinner).
            Massage the chili paste into the drained cabbage (consider using gloves). Continue until all the cabbage is thoroughly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pack the kimchi into a 1-quart jar (use a second jar or a smaller 16-ounce jar if you have extra). Press down on the kimchi until the brine covers the cabbage, leaving at least 1 inch of space between the kimchi and the lid. Place a fermentation weight on top if you have one, and seal the jar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the kimchi in the refrigerator to ferment. After a day, press down on the cabbage with a clean spoon to release trapped air bubbles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy your kimchi at any point!
