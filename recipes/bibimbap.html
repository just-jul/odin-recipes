    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Bibimbap is one of the most well known Korean dishes. A rice bowl topped with all sorts of seasoned sautéed vegetables, marinated meat (usually beef), a fried egg sunny side up, finished with a sprinkle of sesame and generous dollop of a sweet-spicy-savoury Bibimbap sauce. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It's also an affordable meal and the sauce can be made ahead of time to ensure speedy future preparations! Add some homemade (or store-bought) kimchi for the ultimate feast. Just 10 ingredients required.

        <li>
            Kimchi (optional) -> see how to prepare it here: <a href="kimchi.html">Kimchi Recipe</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sesame seeds (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            To a medium saucepan, add cooking water (if you soaked your rice, start with 1 ¼ cups water as recipe is written), rinsed rice, and salt. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender and fluffy. Soaked rice generally takes less time to cook. Unsoaked rice can take up to 30 minutes or more. Keep covered and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, prepare Gochujang sauce. Skip if using store-bought.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the rice finishes cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat (stainless steel or cast iron are best). Once hot, add 1 tsp of sesame oil or enough to just coat the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the oil is hot, add vegetables one type at a time and cook in batches until lightly browned (1-2 minutes), seasoning each with a little minced garlic and a dash of coconut aminos, tamari, or sea salt. Cooking in batches allows you to arrange vegetables separately over the rice for visual effect. We cooked the zucchini first, then carrots, green onion, bean sprouts, and spinach. Add more oil to the pan as needed between vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange cooked vegetables in individual piles on a serving plate and cover gently to keep warm until serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            To cook eggs (if vegan, see notes for options!), heat the same pan over medium heat. Once hot, add a little more oil (sesame or otherwise), and carefully crack eggs. For sunny-side up (our preference), cover briefly with a lid to steam for 1 minute, then remove lid and continue cooking until whites are cooked but yolks are still runny. Turn off heat and set aside (uncovered).
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, divide desired amount of rice between serving bowls and top with portions of cooked veggies and egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with 1-2 Tbsp Gochujang, kimchi (optional), and a dash of sesame seeds (optional). Bibimbap means “mixed rice,” so once your egg and Gochujang sauce are added, use a spoon or your chopsticks to stir everything together and mix the flavors. Then enjoy!
